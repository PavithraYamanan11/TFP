Traffic congestion is a critical issue in urban areas causing delays, increased fuel consumption, and pollution.
Rapid urbanization and increasing vehicle density have worsened traffic conditions, making effective traffic management essential.
Accurate traffic flow prediction is crucial for minimizing congestion, enhancing road safety, and improving urban mobility.
Traditional traffic prediction models like ARIMA and SVM struggle to handle the complex, non-linear nature of traffic data.
Machine learning models like XGBoost provide better solutions than traditional models (ARIMA, SVM) by handling non-linearity, missing data, and high-dimensionality.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7c14697-79c8-483e-aa33-e0afa08d35cf)
